# DDD

## Structure
the structure of the project is as follows:

```

### Details
1. `src/`: The root folder of the source code.
2. `domain/`: This folder contains the domain layer of the application, which represents the core business logic.
    - `entities/`: Contains the entity classes, like Fruit.ts, which define the main building blocks of the domain model.
    - `valueObjects/`: Contains value objects, like `Description.ts`, which are immutable and represent specific aspects of the domain model.
    - `factories/`: Contains factory classes, like `FruitFactory.ts`, which are responsible for creating instances of entities or value objects.
    - `repositories/`: Contains repository interfaces, like `FruitRepository.ts`, which define the contracts for data access and storage.
    - `services/`: Contains domain services, like `UniqueFruitNameService.ts`, which encapsulate domain logic that doesn't fit within a specific entity or value object.
    - `events/`: Contains domain event-related classes, like `FruitDomainEventEmitter.ts`, which handle and manage events generated by the domain layer.
3. `infrastructure/`: This folder contains the infrastructure layer of the application, which deals with external concerns like data storage and communication.
    - `database/`: Contains the database-related code.
        - `mongoose/`: Contains the Mongoose-specific code for the application.
            - `models/`: Contains the Mongoose schema and model definitions, like `FruitModel.ts`.
            - `repositories/`: Contains the Mongoose-based repository implementations, like `MongooseFruitRepository.ts`, which handle data access and storage using Mongoose.
    - `mappers/`: Contains the mapper classes, like `FruitMapper.ts`, which handle the conversion of domain objects to database models and vice versa.


### Why this structure?
This structure helps to maintain a **clean** architecture, where the domain layer is separated from external concerns, like data access and APIs. This makes the code **more maintainable**, **testable**, and **easier to understand**, as each part of the system has a clearly defined purpose.
